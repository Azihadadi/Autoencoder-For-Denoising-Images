# Autoencoder For Denoising Images

This repository contains code to build an autoencoder model. The project includes the following key steps:

## Features

- **Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset**: Efficiently load the dataset and prepare it for training.
- **Add random noise to the dataset**: Enhance the dataset by introducing noise to make the model more robust.
- **Construct a simple autoencoder model**: Build an autoencoder using the Keras functional API.
- **Train the autoencoder**: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
- **Evaluate performance**: Assess the performance of the trained autoencoder on reconstruction tasks.

## Requirements

Make sure to have the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow (including Keras)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, if needed)
